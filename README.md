# Hackathon Practice

Hi guys!

For practice we are gonna make q quick and easy Quiz Website! EVeryone's components shouldn't take long and will give everyone good understanding on the fundementals of git/github react/next.js, and tailwind.

## Ticket ideas:

- Lucas: Add background to page (make sure cant scroll and that background fits properly)
- Gabi: Make header component (just QuizApp title in the middle) and add to page
- Sam: Make multiple choice questions (4 options) and/or input question
- Ashlee: Create Submit button component. Takes currentlySelected prop from Sam's questions component
- Evan: Score bar displaying current score, updates live with increase/decrease animation.
- Andre: Put everyone's components together

Note: Everyone has free reign on design of their component, as long as the logic is correct and works as intended

If you guys have any questions just reach out, good luck!
